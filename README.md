# On The Go Resume - Mobile Application

## Overview
This is a mobile application that generates a resume template in .pdf format based on the user information. I used Flutter SDK and this application is compatible in Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from this codebase. Primarily, the implementation is based on complex data structures to store the information from the users and generate it as a resume. This platform is user friendly and robust.
